EMDR with Nintendo Switch Joycons - created with Gemini

How to use:
1. pair your Nintendo Switch Joycons with your PC: press the pairing button on your left and right joycon while you are adding bluetooth devices.
2. once you have paired both joycons start the html (save it locally).
3. initially it might not find any controllers, try restarting the page.
4. select intensity and frequency (I like 60% intensity and 0.5 Hz)
5. enjoy
